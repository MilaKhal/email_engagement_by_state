## 📧 E-Newsletter engagement by U.S. state

### ❓ Research question
**What are the average email click-through rates across U.S. states?**
### 🔍 Background

This project was conducted for an e-newsletter publishing company preparing statistics for a blog post. The goal was to analyze email click-through rates by U.S. states to identify patterns in engagement. The client sought to determine whether engagement rates were consistent across states or if notable differences existed.

### ⚠️Constraints
At first glance, this seemed like a straightforward project. However, it posed several challenges that required strategic thinking and careful planning.
- First, the client did not aggregate their event data by location, necessitating an analysis of individual-level events—such as deliveries, clicks, and opens—for each mailing sent. This involved processing billions of rows of data stored on an outdated and slow on-premises server.
- Second, the release of Apple’s iOS Mail Privacy Protection feature had inflated email opens, rendering them unreliable for calculating accurate open or click-through rates.
